# BSTVisualiser
PROJECT NAME:-BinarySearchTree Visualizer

PROBLEM:-
Develop a web-based Binary Search Tree (BST) simulator to visually demonstrate the construction and deletion of nodes in a BST. The goal is to make understanding BST operations intuitive and engaging for learners and educators.

OUTPUT:-
A Flask-based web application was implemented where users can input values to construct or delete nodes from a BST. The application dynamically renders the BST structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a visual representation of the tree after each operation. The backend handles BST logic, ensuring accurate insertion and deletion.

REQUIREMENTS:-
Python: For backend logic using Flask framework.
HTML, CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For dynamic updates and tree visualization.

METHODOLOGY:-
Users input comma-separated values to insert into the BST.The Python backend processes these values, performing insertions and updates to the BST.The updated BST structure is returned as JSON to the frontend.JavaScript dynamically renders the BST structure, visually displaying nodes and their relationships.Users can similarly delete nodes, with the backend ensuring proper restructuring of the BST and updating the visual representation.

CONCLUSION:-
This BST simulator successfully integrates Python for logical operations and web technologies for visualization, creating an interactive learning tool. It aids users in comprehending BST operations through hands-on interaction and visual feedback, enhancing the learning experience.
